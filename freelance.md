I am currently open to working on freelance missions as an external contractor.

I am an experienced engineer who has had the chance to work on a range of
different software and infrastructure projects. I consider myself versatile and
pragmatic, with a capacity to adapt quickly to new environments.

Here is a non exhaustive list of services I am comfortable providing to
customers:

- Development of maintainable and performant Go applications, from design to
  production.
- Architecture of distributed systems, particularly of event-driven systems.
- Extension of Kubernetes through custom controllers, and operation of clusters
  at scale.
- Everything related to Linux containers, from runtimes to orchestrators.
- Introduction to unikernels, and integration with existing ecosystems.
- Automation of cloud infrastructures and server configurations.
- Software lifecycle management through CI/CD pipelines.
- Trainings on all the aforementioned technologies and practices.
- Contributions to Rust codebases.

My tax residence is Germany.

Please refer to my LinkedIn profile in the footer for an extended description
of the projects I have worked on over the past 14 years.
