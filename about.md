## The blog

Social medias are an excellent way to relay information and keep up with the technologies I'm passionate about,
unfortunately none of the platforms I use on a daily basis are really made for authoring content. This is what this blog
is for, contributing articles about the cool things I do at work and sometimes in my free time, in more than 140
characters.

It'd be impossible for me to give a clear framework to this blog, I'm interested in everything related in one way or
another to infrastructure-as-code, continuous delivery and virtualization. Nowadays these subjects are so in vogue that
the list of technologies I wish I could experiment with is litterally endless.

The opinions expressed in the content I publish are my own. This blog is entirely [open-source][oss] and powered by
[Jekyll][jekyll]. If you like a post and feel like sharing it you can, but are not obliged to, mention my Twitter
username *@AntoineCotten*.

## The author

I am a Technical Operations Engineer with a strong focus on building a DevOps culture around platform and release
automation. I have had the chance to work in companies of different sizes, in a variety of industries, and to approach
a multitude of problems in so many different ways.

I love sharing the knowledge I have and help people understanding the technologies I am fond of, as much as I love
hearing other people telling about their experiences in the tech industry. You can sometimes find me on
[StackExchange][stack] helping people answering questions I've had to ask myself at some point as well.

I'm originally from [Bretagne][brit], arguably the most beautiful part of France, but this didn't stop me from moving to
[Munich][muc], Germany, in 2012.
