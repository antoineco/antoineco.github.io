Software developer with a strong background in infrastructure and operations, my focus used to be on building a DevOps
culture around platform and release automation. Nowadays, I spend most of my time engineering the software that shapes
the technologies which I believe can positively affect our future.

I am particularly fond of **unikernels** and **Linux containers**, especially in combination with my platform of
expertise: **Kubernetes**. I work first and foremost in the **Go** programming language.

I have had the chance to join companies of different sizes, in a variety of industries, and to approach a multitude of
problems in so many different ways.

I am originally from [Bretagne][brit], arguably the most beautiful region of France, but this didn't stop me from moving
to [Munich][muc], Germany, in 2012.
